django-correx
==============

A set of models and template tags for pulling in lists of content changes across applications.

Installation
============

01. Download the .tar.gz distribution file from http://code.google.com/p/django-correx/ and untar it.
(Optionally, you can pull the latest revision from the source code's trunk at http://github.com/palewire/django-correx/tree/master)
02. Navigate to the untarred directory in the terminal
03. Enter `python setup.py install` and the package will install itself on your PYTHONPATH
04. Add 'correx' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
05. Run 'python manage.py syncdb' to create the database tables
06  Add `(r'^correx/', include('correx.urls')),` to your root urls.py file
07. Copy the `media` folder included in the tar file to your MEDIA_URL if you intended to use the sample icons

That's it! I've tried to explain how everything works in the docstrings. 

If you have any additional questions or think that any of this merits longer documentation, shoot me
an email at <palewire@palewire.com>. Criticisms, bug reports and hate mail all appreciated.
