=============
django-correx
=============

A model and set of template tags that can be used to pull in 
lists of updates, deletions and corrections across numerous apps.

The objective isn't a complete, automagic catalog of every change to the database, 
but instead a curated list of changes intended for presentation to the public.

The name is drawn from 'correx', a common newspaper slang term for each day's corrections list.

This is a very ugly, early release by a well-meaning, but perhaps misguided, person. 

Almost all of the good parts are lifted from such great pluggable apps as 
django.contrib.comments and django-tagging

Criticism, feedback and fan-mail all appreciated at <palewire@palewire.com>
