h1. Installation

# Pull the latest revision from the source code's trunk at "http://github.com/palewire/django-correx/tree/master":http://github.com/palewire/django-correx/tree/master
# Navigate to the cloned directory in the terminal
# Enter 'python setup.py install' and the package will install itself on your PYTHONPATH
# Add 'correx' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
# Run 'python manage.py syncdb' to create the database tables
# Add '(r'^correx/', include('correx.urls')),' to your root urls.py file
# Copy the `media` folder to your MEDIA_URL if you intended to use the sample icons

That's it! I've tried to explain how everything works in the docstrings. 

If you have any additional questions or think that any of this merits longer documentation, shoot me
an email at palewire@palewire.com. Criticisms, bug reports and hate mail all appreciated.
