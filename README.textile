h1. django-correx

A set of models and template tags for pulling in lists of content changes across applications.

The objective isn't a complete, automagic catalog of every change to the database, 
but instead a curated list of changes intended for presentation to the public.

The name is drawn from 'correx', a common newspaper slang term for each day's corrections list.

h3. Contributing

This is a very ugly, early release by a well-meaning, but perhaps misguided, person. 

Almost all of the good parts are lifted from such great pluggable apps as 
django.contrib.comments and django-tagging
